          The client wants the creation of a brand new identity that will allow
          him to identify differently against the competition. With the redesign
          and the creation of a new identity will come the creation of a
          website, which will aim to show the different services offered and to
          learn a little more about the driver.

        Sober and elegant. The identity of taxiallan.fr must convey an image of
        irreproachable service and trust. This is why, like New York taxis, the
        color chart is oriented towards yellow and black. Service known
        worldwide for its transport services. It is easy to attach the yellow
        and black to the taxis hence this choice for the identity of
        taxiallan.fr which will determine the whole aspect of the site, business
        cards or even the logo.
