            I started my journey quite some time ago as a graphic designer, but
            missing something in my life and having a special affinity for
            website, I decided to switched to web design and web development.
            Fast forward, after having taking classes to learn web developement
            I wasn't sure about my choice because it didn't give me joy and
            excitement of creation from scratch. That's why I focus myself more
            on the web design part. So here I am, full of enthusiam and ideas,
            ready to conquer the a√πazing world of design.

            And one more thing. I am curious. I love to explore the world and
            all the possibilies it offers, to constantly learn and try new
            things.

            I have good knowledge of Abode suite by my past as a graphic
            designer but that's not all I also have good knowledge of Figma,
            HTML, CSS and Javascript. I can do research, customer journey map,
            user flow maps, wire-framing, prototyping and design. I can easily
            do a competitor analysis. I am kind of an overthinker when it comes
            to solutions to problem which helps me considerably to come up with
            the ideal UX approaches for different scenarios. My mission to
            create a product that perfectly solves users problems, whilist
            meeting business goals.

            My past experience taught me a lot. I have been a Apple Specialist
            for three years which taught me patience, team work and finding
            solutions for clients pretty fast to lead to a sale. I understand
            problems and can easily find a solution to solve it. My experience
            as a graphic designer taught me to develop an infinite curiosity and
            to ever learn new stuffs, trends, or methods to do things.

            But that's not everything about me. In fact my first passion and my
            deepest connection is with cars. And what I mean by cars is
            everything related with the automobile world, so racing and his
            history, car culture, modifying a car, driving. It's more than a
            passion, it's a way of life. I breathe, eat and sleep with cars in
            my mind. <br></br>
            This passion thought me so much, design and power but also
            curiosity. It taught me how to do an informative watch.
